**In this manifesto, we argue for researchers to write their papers in "research repositories" (one per paper) where each repository contains the full text of their paper, as well as the scripts, tools, and other supporting materials that enable others to quickly use some or all of that work for other tasks.**

For years, software engineering research has lamented the lack of repeated results. Yet the art of software engineering continues to evolve. Today we can build bigger software systems, used by more people, that run on more computers, than ever before. Why? How?

Perhaps we have misunderstood _repeatable_, at least in the context of software.

+ In the hard science world, things hardly change. So when one scientist studies
a grain of grass, it is possible that previously reserachers might have seen the same kinds of grass. 
+ In the software world, things are softer and easier to change. So tomorrow's software applications are different
to that of today. Tomorrow, when we use software, we many be using different tools, touch different users, perform different tasks, run on different platforms. So when one software scientist studes a _database_, it may well be that that kind of _database_ has not been studied before.

Perhaps instead of _repeatbality_, we need to talk about partial _reusability_. That is, we want to read each other's code,
check out each other's systems, since it is possible that _some part_ of what they did is relevant to what we want to accomplish today. 

In this "reusability" mode, we take a hammer to prior products and cut them up into many pieces. These become menu items that we build new stuff by mixing and matching (or ignoring) some parts of old stuff.

To support that kind of _reuse_, we take a second look at _research artifact_. 

+ _Research artifacts may be smaller than a single research paper._ When an SE researcher delivers a paper, she is not reporting some complete diamond, perfect in every way, that is destroyed if any little part is removed. Rather, she is reporting on a complex combination of artifacts, any one of which might be useful in a bro
